<Seperate Image>
Create a main program which;
1. Requests the initial balances for two separate accounts
2. Creates two Account objects
3. Requests an amount to deposit in the first account
4. Requests an amount to withdraw from the first account
5. Displays the current balance of that account
6. Repeats steps 3-5 with the second account
7. This requires that both Account objects be active at the same time
Upload: Your .cpp and .h files with the Account class and main program.
